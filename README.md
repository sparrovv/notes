# Notes

This repo contains notes about ideas or problems I had to solve.


## Structure

- posts - finished or semi-finished notes, that I've put effort to edit so someone else can read it
- drafts - ideas that I'd like to explore in more depth one day

## Workflow

I use Evernote to catch ideas.
If the idea is something I'm interested in, I'll try to write down the questions worth answering.
Once I have the questions written down, next thing is the research(google).
